DRAMP00856	GLPVCGETCVGGTCNTPGCTCSWPVCTRN	29	Kalata-B1 (Plant defensin)	P56254	Belongs to the cyclotide family	OAK1	Oldenlandia affinis 	"Antimicrobial, Antibacterial, Anti-Gram+, Anti-Gram-, Antifungal, Antiviral"	Protein level	Beta strand (3 strands; 7 residues)	Not found	2KHB resolved by NMR.	"Function: Probably participates in a plant defense mechanism. Has antibiotic activity. Has a diuretic effect. Has a uterotonic effect in humans. Active against the Gram-positive S. aureus. Relatively ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Inhibitory effect on the growth and development of larvae from H. punctigera. The unmodified form has hemolytic activity, the oxidized form lacks hemolytic activity. If the protein is linearized, hemolytic activity is lost.
MOA: a small number of cyclotides bind to the membrane surface and then insert first into the outer membrane leaflet followed by penetration through the membrane and pore formation. At higher concentrations of cyclotides, destabilization of membranes occurs.
Tissue specificity: Leaves and stems. Lower in roots.
Pharmaceutical use: The uteroactive properties of Kalata have been discovered by African traditional medicine. It is used as an ingredient of a herbal tea to accelerate childbirth.
PTM: Kalata-B1 is a cyclic peptide which contains three disulfide bonds 5-19; 11-21; 14-26."

Biotechnological use: Overexpression of this protein to provide quantities adequate for medical use as a topical microbiocide has been attempted in a number of systems including E.coli, Lactobacillus jensenii, the yeast Pichia pastoris and Nicotiana tabacum. One fusion construct for overexpression of this protein can be found in entry AC D1WFZ2.
Miscellaneous: Its activity in situ is Not found, however it acts as a viral entry inhibitor, inhibiting HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (and some other viruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus, measles virus and human herpesvirus) infection and replication. It prevents essential interactions between the envelope glycoprotein and target cell receptors by binding to carbohydrates on viral protein gp120 and possibly by other mechanisms as well. Addition to cells must occur before or shortly after virus addition. It also inhibits cell-to-cell fusion, and virus-to-cell and cell-to-cell transmission of a viral infection. Is remarkably stabile; the protein can withstand multiple freeze-thaw cycles, dissolution in organic solvents, treatment with salt, detergent, H2O2 and boiling without significant loss of anti-HIV activity."
