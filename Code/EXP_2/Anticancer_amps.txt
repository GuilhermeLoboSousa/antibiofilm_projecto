Exhibits diverse biological activities, such as hemorrhage, edema, apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells or tumor cell lines, as well as regulation of platelet aggregation. Effects of snake L-amino oxidases on platelets are controversial, since they either induce aggregation or inhibit agonist-induced aggregation. These different effects are probably due to different experimental conditions By similarity. This protein induce hemolysis and has antibacterial and antiparasitic activities (against the Gram-positive S.aureus). Tested in vivo, this protein significantly inhibits Ehrlich ascite tumors growth and induces an influx of polymorphonuclear cells, as well as spontaneous liberation of hydrogen peroxide from peritoneal macrophages.
Tissue specificity: Expressed by the venom gland.
Miscellaneous: Has parasiticidal activities against both trypanosomes and leishmania, as a result of enzyme-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide production."	Gram-positive bacterium: S. aureus.
