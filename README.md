# antibiofilm_project

Biofilm resistance has increased, posing a serious threat to public health, making it imperative to develop effective control measures for biofilm-associated infections. In this study, we intend to explore machine learning models to predict peptides with anti-biofilm capacity. Two experiments were carried out: one focused on peptides associated with the human immune system and another more general.

## Task description:

Binary classification. Given a peptide sequence string, predict whether it is antibiofilm (1) or not (0).

## Dataset statistics:

In total, we have three sets of data for experiments 1 and 2.

## General information
In the "Code" folder we have 2 folders ("EXP1" e "EXP2") that contain the code and documents necessary to obtain the results demonstrated in the article.
